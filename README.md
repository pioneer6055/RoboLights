Controllable LED lights for FRC robot

This project will use a Trinket microcontroller to accept a 0-5v analog signal from the RoboRIO to select between LED output modes on the 5050 addressable LED strip. Since we are using a 3 amp converter to drive the LED strip, no more than 60 LEDs should be on the strip. If you want more LEDâ€™s on the strip, use a DC-DC converter with a higher amp rating. Fifteen different colors/animation modes are available plus off mode.
